# Little Go Tutorial

This tutorial is intended to introduce you to Go from the perspects of systems programming in C.

## Getting Started

The process of building Go applications uses a set of file system conventions 
a Makefile.  It treats a directory in your file system as *a workspace*.


The environment variable `$GOPATH` is set to yoiur current workspace. It
is assumed to contains subdirectories:

* `$GOPATH/src` contains Go source files.  Conventionally, each application is in
a directory there
* `$GOPATH/bin` contains executables

Our first example is in `$GOPATH/src/cmdline1`










You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/deculler/gotut/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/deculler/gotut/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
